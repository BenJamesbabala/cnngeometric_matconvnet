# CNNGeometric MatConvNet implementation

![](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/cnngeometric/images/teaser.png)

This is the implementation of the paper: 

I. Rocco, R. ArandjeloviÄ‡ and J. Sivic. Convolutional neural network architecture for geometric matching. CVPR 2017 [[website](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/cnngeometric/)][[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05593)]

using the MatConvNet toolbox for MATLAB

### Getting started ###
  - demo.m downloads trained models and shows how to perform alignment
  - evaluate.m shows how to evaluate the trained models on the ProposalFlow and Caltech-101 datasets.
  - demo_train.m shows how to train a new model
